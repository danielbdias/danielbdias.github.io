Hello! I'm Daniel, a software developer and AI researcher located on São Paulo, Brazil, working as a Software Developer at [Wildlife Studios](https://wildlifestudios.com/) and being a doctorate candidate on the [Mathematics and Statitics Institute](http://www.ime.usp.br/) of the [University of São Paulo](http://www.usp.br/).

On this webpage you will see some of my personal work and academic studies. While I'm not doing work I'm playing videogames, training kung-fu or having a good time with my wife and my 3-year old daughter. =)

If you need to contact me, feel free to send me message at "danielbpdias at gmail.com", "danielbdias at usp.br" or on my twitter [@danielbdias](https://twitter.com/danielbdias).
