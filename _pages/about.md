Hello! I'm Daniel, a software developer and AI researcher located in Foz do Iguaçu, Paraná, Brazil, working as a Senior Software Developer at [Kubeshop](https://kubeshop.io/) and being a doctorate student at the [Mathematics and Statistics Institute](http://www.ime.usp.br/) of the [University of São Paulo](http://www.usp.br/).

On this webpage, you will see some of my work and academic studies. While I'm not doing work I'm playing video games, training kung-fu or discovering the world with my wife and my 6-year-old daughter. =)

If you need to contact me, feel free to send me a message at "danielbpdias at gmail.com", "danielbdias at usp.br" or on my Twitter [@danielbdias](https://twitter.com/danielbdias).
