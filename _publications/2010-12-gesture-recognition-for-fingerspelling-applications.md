title: "Gesture recognition for fingerspelling applications: an approach based on sign language cheremes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-12-gesture-recognition-for-fingerspelling-applications
excerpt: 'This paper presents an approach for carrying out gesture recognition for the Brazilian Sign Language Manual Alphabet. The gestural patterns are treated as a combination of three primitives, or cheremes-hand configuration, hand orientation and hand movement. The recognizer is built in a modular architecture composed by inductive reasoning modules, which use the artificial neural network Fuzzy Learning Vector Quantization; and rule-based modules. This architecture has been tested and results are presented here. Some strengths of such approach are: robustness of recognition, portability to similar contexts, extensibility of the dataset to be recognize and reduction of the vocabulary recognition problem to the recognition of its primitives.'

This paper presents an approach for carrying out gesture recognition for the Brazilian Sign Language Manual Alphabet. The gestural patterns are treated as a combination of three primitives, or cheremes-hand configuration, hand orientation and hand movement. The recognizer is built in a modular architecture composed by inductive reasoning modules, which use the artificial neural network Fuzzy Learning Vector Quantization; and rule-based modules. This architecture has been tested and results are presented here. Some strengths of such approach are: robustness of recognition, portability to similar contexts, extensibility of the dataset to be recognize and reduction of the vocabulary recognition problem to the recognition of its primitives.
